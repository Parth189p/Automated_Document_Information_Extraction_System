## Overview
An intelligent document processing system that automates the extraction of structured data from financial documents using state-of-the-art machine learning models. The system processes multi-page documents, extracts relevant information, and populates Excel templates automatically.

## 🎯 Problem Statement
Financial institutions deal with numerous documents that require manual data extraction and entry into structured formats. This project automates this process, reducing processing time and human error.

## 🚀 Key Features
- **Document Processing Pipeline**
  - Multi-page PDF parsing and OCR processing
  - Intelligent text extraction and classification
  - Automated data validation and error checking
  - Excel template auto-population

- **Advanced ML Capabilities**
  - ColBERT-based document retrieval system
  - Azure OpenAI integration for context understanding
  - PyTesseract for accurate OCR processing
  - Custom NER models for financial data extraction
